# Cuadrado's Trials

This is my entry for the [GameDev.tv Community Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-community-jam).

The link for the game is here: <https://msanatan.itch.io/cuadrados-trials>


## How to Build?

This game is made with [Phaser](http://phaser.io/). To build this project locally you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) + [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (NPM is included in Node.js installations). After you clone this repo, execute the following commands:

1. `npm i` - this installs all the dependencies for the game
1. `npm start` - this runs the game in a dev server

To create a production build of this game, run `npm run build`.

## License

I've not yet decided an appropriate license for this game. Until I do, please respect my copyright to all the code I've written and graphical assets I've created.

### Graphics

I made all the graphics myself using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org) - by far the best pixel editor I've used.

### Fonts

* [Minecraft](https://www.dafont.com/minecraft.font)
* [Pixel Inversion](https://www.dafont.com/pixel-inversions.font)

#### Audio

* All sound effects came from [512 Sound Effects (8-bit style)](https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style)
* Made my game complete sound with [BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co)

### Level Design
